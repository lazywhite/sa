概念
    Issuer, ClusterIssuer
        相当于CA, 用于签发证书
    Certificate
        相当于crt， 已经被认证过的证书
    CertificateRequest
        相当于csr，向CA发起的请求

    ACME Orders and Challenges
         To successfully request a certificate, cert-manager must solve ACME Challenges which are completed in order to prove that the client owns the DNS addresses that are being requested.

        ACME: Automated Certificate Management Environment, Let's Encrypt使用此协议进行证书签发
        Order: An order represents a single certificate request which will be created automatically once a new CertificateRequest resource referencing an ACME issuer has been created. 不需要手工create
        Challenges: challenge resources are used by the ACME issuer to manage the lifecycle of an ACME ‘challenge’ that must be completed in order to complete an ‘authorization’ for a single DNS name/identifier.

安装
    https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/
    Kubernetes 1.15 or higher: you can use the normal cert-manager.yaml
    Kubernetes 1.14 or lower: you have to now use the cert-manager-legacy.yaml version   (cert-manager-v1.0.0)
    kubectl apply -f cert-manager-legacy.yaml
配置
    1. issuer, clusterIssuer
        SelfSigned
        CA
        Vault
        Venafi
        External
        ACME
使用
    1. certificate resource
        提交一个Certificate, 里面规定issuer, issuer将会生成一个CertificateRequest，成功后将把signed certificate存储在同
        namespace下的secret里面

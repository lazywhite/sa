============ 进程 ============
Process Table
	PID  PCB

每个进程启动会被分配一个PID, 由于进程会被调度，需要跟踪每个进程的状态，所以操作系统会为每一个PID维护一个PCB(process controll block)
Process Table里面存储的就是PCB列表

PCB保存的信息
	Pointer – It is a stack pointer which is required to be saved when the process is switched from one state to another to retain the current position of the process.
	Process state – It stores the respective state of the process.
	Process number – Every process is assigned with a unique id known as process ID or PID which stores the process identifier.
	Program counter – It stores the counter which contains the address of the next instruction that is to be executed for the process.
	Register – These are the CPU registers which includes: accumulator, base, registers and general purpose registers.
	Memory limits – This field contains the information about memory management system used by operating system. This may include the page tables, segment tables etc.
	Open files list – This information includes the list of files opened for a process.
	Miscellaneous accounting and status data 



============ 线程 ============

对于线程的实现，取决于操作系统，有的(Solaris)在内核空间实现(kThread)，有的(linux)在用户空间实现(pThread)

kThread
	kernel仅维护一个Thread Table(不是在每个进程内部一个TT)
 	thread table就是一个tcb的列表

pThread
	对于linux kernel来说没有thread的概念，而是用标准的process来实现，只不过这些process可以跟其它process共享内存

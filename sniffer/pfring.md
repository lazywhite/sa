PF_RINGâ„¢ is a Linux kernel module and user-space framework that allows you to process packets at high-rates while providing you a consistent API for packet processing applications.

No need to patch the kernel: just load the kernel module.

 User-space ZC (new generation DNA, Direct NIC Access) drivers for extreme packet capture/transmission speed as the NIC NPU (Network Process Unit) is pushing/getting packets to/from userland without any kernel intervention. Using the 10Gbit ZC driver you can send/received at wire-speed at any packet sizes.

  PF_RING ZC library for distributing packets in zero-copy across threads, applications, Virtual Machines.

## Concept
Pig is a platform for analyzing large dataset that consists of a high-level  
language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure  
for evaluating these programs. The salient property of Pig program is that  
their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turn  
enables them to handle very large dataset  

**Pig Latin**: Pig's infrastructure layer compiler to produce sequnce of  
MapReduce programs  which has **ease of programming**, **optimization opportunities**  
**extensibility** properties

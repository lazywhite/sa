## Introduction

spark streaming is an extension of the core spark-api that enables scalable  
high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams  
data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume or TCP socket  
and can be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high-level  
function like "map, reduce, join, window", finally processed data can be  
pushed out to filesystems, databases, and live dashboards.  you can apply  
spark's "Machine Learning" and "Graph Processing" algorithms on data streams

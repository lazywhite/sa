## Introduction
Apache Storm is a free and open source distributed realtime computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing

它旨在用于分布式实时处理且与语言无关
## Use case
Realtime analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, distributed RPC, ETL, and more

Storm integrates with the queueing and database technologies you already use. A Storm topology consumes streams of data and processes those streams in arbitrarily complex ways, repartitioning the streams between each stage of the computation however needed.

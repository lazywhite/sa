## Machine learning
### Introduction
Machine learning is a branch of science that deals with programming the system  
in such a way that they automatically learn and improve with exprience   
Here learning means recognizing and understanding the input data and making  
wise decisions based on the supplied data

```
common machine learning algorithms
    Recommendation
        provides close recommandation base on user information subch as 
        previous purchases, clicks, and rating
        example: taobao
    Classification
        also known as categorization, use known data to determine how the  
        new data should be classified into a set of existing categories  
        example: mail spam 
    Clustering
        is used to form groups or clusters of similar data based on   
        common characteristics  is a form of unsupervised learning
        exmaple: google
```

### Developed Algorithms  

```
    vision processing
    language processing
    forecasting
    pattern recognition
    games
    data mining
    expert system
    robotics
```

### supervised learning
```
supervised learning deals with learning a function from available training data  
a supervised learning algorithm analyze the training data and produces an inferred  
function, which can be used for mapping new example.    
    
common approache to supervised learning
    classifying e-mails as spam
    labeling webpages based on their content
    voice recognition
```
  
### Unsupervised Learning
    
```
unsupervised learning makes sense of unlabeled data without having any predefined  
dataset for its training. is a powerful tool for analyzing available data and  
look for patterns and trends, it is most commonly used for clustering similar   
input into logical groups

common approaches to unsupervised learning
    k-means
    self-organizing maps 
    hierachical clustering

## Introduction
HCatalog is a table storage management tool for Hadoop. It exposes the tabular data of Hive metastore to other Hadoop applications. It enables users with different data processing tools (Pig, MapReduce) to easily write data onto a grid. It ensures that users don’t have to worry about where or in what format their data is stored.

HCatalog works like a key component of Hive and it enables the users to store their data in any format and any structure.


HCatalog is built on top of the Hive metastore and incorporates Hive's DDL. HCatalog provides read and write interfaces for Pig and MapReduce and uses Hive's command line interface for issuing data definition and metadata exploration commands.

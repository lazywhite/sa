Nginx rewrite is used to change request URI using regular expressions, return redirects, and conditionally select configurations.

The ngx_http_rewrite_module module directives are processed in the following order:

the directives of this module specified on the server level are executed sequentially;
repeatedly:
a location is searched based on a request URI;
the directives of this module specified inside the found location are executed sequentially;
the loop is repeated if a request URI was rewritten, but not more than 10 times.

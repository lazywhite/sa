### how nginx process a request

[request process doc](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html)
1. decides which server should process the request by "Host" header
    if this value doesn't match any server name or value is null, nginx will 
    route this request to default server
    if you don't allow request withou "Host" header, you can define a vhost whose
    server name is ""
2. nginx first searches for the most specific prefix location given by literal strings regardless of the listed order.
